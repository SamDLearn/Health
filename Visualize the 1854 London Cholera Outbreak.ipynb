The medical community at the time was divided about the causes of cholera.  Some believed that the illness was airborne, whereas Dr. John Snow believed that it was water borne. To prove his theory, Dr. Snow began collecting data about water sources, the number of deaths, the dates of these deaths, etc.  \n\nIn this analysis, we step into the good doctor's shoes and walk in his footsteps. We also prove the value in visualizing data, especially geospatial data which is so readily available today due to the advent of sensors and drones.\n\nFor more information, see:\n- <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener no referrer\">Dr. John Snow</a>\n- <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1854_Broad_Street_cholera_outbreak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener no referrer\">The 1854 London Cholera Outbreak</a>  \n\nThis analysis uses materials sourced from the \"HistData\" R package, which is available under a GPL license.

Over the next 3 days, 127 people on or near Broad Street died. \n\nThe heavy death toll continued over the next few days although the number of deaths on a daily basis started to reduce from its peak on 2 September 1854 (mostly driven by mass evacuations of people from the Broad Street area).  \n\nWe can plot the number of deaths during this time in the following chart:"
